        I’m interested in building AI systems that are powerful, interpretable, and grounded in
        real-world applications.

        <strong>Interpretable &amp; Explicit Neural Architectures</strong>
        <p>
          I’m working towards models that provide explicit mathematical representations of the
          relationships they learn, rather than acting as pure black boxes. This includes
          polynomial-style networks and architectures where the learned mapping between inputs
          and outputs can be expressed and reasoned about directly.

        <strong>Multimodal AI (Vision + Language + Time-Series)</strong>
        <p>
          My internships and projects have pushed me towards multimodal settings: Visual Question
          Answering, stock market prediction from heterogeneous signals, and interfaces that
          combine 3D medical imagery with textual/structured data. I’m interested in how
          transformers and attention mechanisms can fuse modalities while still retaining a
          level of interpretability.

        <strong>AI for Physical Systems &amp; Manufacturing</strong>
        <p>
          Through my work at the Center for Additive Manufacturing, I’ve seen how AI can help
          compress complex physical interactions into usable models: predicting strength,
          detecting printing defects, and optimizing process parameters. I’m interested in
          extending these ideas to other engineering domains with rich sensor data.

        <strong>Long-term Goals</strong>
        <p>
          My long-term goal is to pursue graduate studies and contribute to core research in
          machine learning and optimization, especially in directions that make AI more
          explainable and trustworthy. I want to work at the intersection of theory,
          architecture design, and practical deployment.
