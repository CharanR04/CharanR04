      <p class="page-subtitle">
        Computer Science (AI &amp; ML) undergraduate from Chennai, building towards a research
        career in interpretable and multimodal AI.
      </p>

      <div class="card">
        <p>
          I am currently pursuing my B.E. in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence &amp;
          Machine Learning) at Chennai Institute of Technology. My work so far has centred on
          computer vision, natural language processing, and time-series forecasting, with a
          strong emphasis on how models can be made more interpretable and practically useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through research internships at NIT Tiruchirappalli and UTAR Malaysia, as well as
          ongoing work at my institute’s Center for Additive Manufacturing, I’ve had the
          opportunity to explore multimodal VQA systems, forecasting architectures, and
          AI-assisted manufacturing workflows.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy environments where theory, experimentation, and engineering come together:
          designing architectures, analysing model behaviour, and thinking about how these
          systems can support human decision-making in a transparent way.

          <p style="margin-top: 8px;">
            Core areas: deep learning, computer vision, NLP, optimization, data structures and
            algorithms, and database systems. Previous schooling at Maharishi Vidya Mandir
            (CBSE).

          <strong>Current Focus</strong><br />
          Interpretable neural architectures, multimodal learning (vision + language +
          structured data), and AI for physical systems such as manufacturing and water
          infrastructure.
          <p style="margin-top: 8px;">
            I’m gradually moving towards research questions that sit between theory and
            deployment—how to design models that are both expressive and understandable.

            I like building end-to-end prototypes: from experimenting in notebooks to
            preparing datasets, training models, and designing small interfaces or dashboards
            around them.
